# QMA React Frontend

This directory contains the active Vite + React + TypeScript application on
branch `frontend/vite-react-rebuild`. It is the rebuild frontend, separate
from the root legacy HTML files and `public/app.js`/`public/*.css`.

## Application shape

```text
frontend/src/main.tsx
        |
        v
src/app/App.tsx
        |
        +--> routeFromPath() / history + popstate
        +--> WalletProvider (shared connected-wallet state)
        +--> LandingPage       /
        +--> AppPage           /app
        +--> ProfileOrdersPage /profile
        +--> MarketplaceReview /marketplace
```

## Routes and source of truth

| Route | Page owner | Main behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/` | `components/landing/LandingPage.tsx` | product landing and navigation |
| `/app` | `components/reports/AppPage.tsx` | live signals, query, payment, report workspace, agent UI |
| `/profile` | `components/profile/ProfileOrdersPage.tsx` | wallet-bound profile, purchased reports, payment history |
| `/marketplace` | `components/marketplace/MarketplaceReview.tsx` | provider catalog and creator review/apply flows |

`App.tsx` owns only route composition and the wallet provider. Feature state
belongs in feature hooks/components; API and payment boundaries belong in
`services/`; reusable cross-page wallet state belongs in `state/walletStore.tsx`.

## API base URL

`src/services/api.ts` resolves the API base in this order:

1. `VITE_QMA_API_BASE_URL` when supplied;
2. empty string on local hostnames, so Vite can proxy/same-origin with a local
   FastAPI server;
3. the legacy fallback `https://qma-api.onrender.com` when no rebuild API is
   configured.

For the rebuild preview deployment, set:

```env
VITE_QMA_API_BASE_URL=https://qma-api-rebuild.onrender.com
VITE_QMA_ENV=preview
VITE_QMA_SYNTHETIC_RUN=false
```

Never place service-role keys, admin tokens, access-token secrets, gateway
secrets, or private keys in Vite variables.

## Agent UI flow

The browser agent uses the same backend decision boundary as the CLI. The
browser wallet remains the authorization boundary for live payment.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    actor User
    participant UI as AppPage / AgentBuyerModal
    participant Hook as useAgentBuyer
    participant API as FastAPI /agent/decision
    participant Invoice as Invoice service
    participant Wallet as Browser wallet
    participant Gateway as Arc Gateway
    participant Report as Report service

    User->>UI: Enter prompt and constraints
    UI->>Hook: handleAgentRun()
    Hook->>API: POST /api/v1/agent/decision
    API-->>Hook: canonical candidate + policy/rejections
    Hook-->>UI: show decision rationale and rejected candidates
    Hook->>Invoice: create provider-bound invoice
    Invoice-->>UI: invoice requirements
    UI->>Wallet: request user signature(s)
    Wallet->>Gateway: settle x402 split legs
    Gateway-->>UI: leg receipts
    UI->>API: verify settlement
    API-->>UI: entitlement/access token when permitted
    UI->>Report: fetch paid preview/full report
    Report-->>UI: unlocked report workspace
```

If the decision endpoint is unavailable and a wallet is connected, live
autonomous execution is blocked. The wallet must never bypass the backend
decision and payment checks. A wallet-less local/demo path may use its local
recommendation fallback for presentation only.

## Shared state and service boundaries

- `state/walletStore.tsx`: connected wallet address, persistence key, and
  disconnect cleanup shared by app/profile/marketplace.
- `state/reportStore.ts`: report display state when used by a feature owner.
- `state/invoiceStore.ts`: invoice state boundary available for payment-hook
  integration; current AppPage flows still own some invoice orchestration.
- `hooks/useWalletConnection.ts`: injected-wallet connection, chain checks, and
  signing prerequisites.
- `hooks/usePendingInvoiceCache.ts`: resumable invoice/report cache helpers.
- `hooks/usePayment.ts`: payment lifecycle orchestration.
- `hooks/useAgentBuyer.ts`: browser agent session UI state and calls to the
  shared decision service.
- `services/invoices.ts`, `reports.ts`, `agent.ts`, and `x402.ts`: network and
  payment integration boundaries.

Do not move signing, settlement verification, entitlement issuance, or access
token validation into presentational components.

## Development and verification

```powershell
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
npm run typecheck
npm run build
```

The production build is emitted to `frontend/dist/`; never edit it directly.
Direct refreshes of `/app`, `/profile`, and `/marketplace` depend on the SPA
rewrite in the root `vercel.json`.

For payment behavior, consult [`PAYMENT_FLOW.md`](../PAYMENT_FLOW.md)
before editing sensitive services. For deployment, consult
[`docs/DEPLOYMENT_SETUP.md`](../docs/DEPLOYMENT_SETUP.md).
