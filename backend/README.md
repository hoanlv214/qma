# QMA Backend

The active backend source of truth is `backend/app/`. It is a FastAPI
application composed from endpoint factories, schemas, services, repositories,
and core process state.

The root `main.py` is only the Render-compatible shim. It exports the same
`backend.app.main.app` object and keeps `uvicorn main:app` and legacy tests
working. It is not a second business-logic implementation.

## Runtime and ownership

```text
Render / local uvicorn
        |
        v
root main.py (compatibility shim)
        |
        v
backend.app.main:app
        |
        +--> endpoint factory under api/v1/endpoints/
        +--> Pydantic schema under schemas/
        +--> service under services/
        +--> repository / external client
        +--> JSON or Supabase persistence selected by configuration
```

`backend/app/api/v1/router.py` is a reusable aggregation module, but the
running app currently registers the factory routers directly in
`backend/app/main.py`. Do not infer runtime registration from the comment in
the aggregation module alone.

## Endpoint groups

| Group | Runtime owner | Main responsibilities |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Health/config | `endpoints/health.py` | health, public config, gateway info, engine profile |
| Market/agent discovery | `endpoints/market.py` | live anomalies, market cache, agent recommendations |
| Agent decision | `endpoints/agent.py` | `POST /api/v1/agent/decision` shared by React and CLI |
| Providers/marketplace | `endpoints/providers.py` | provider catalog, applications, approval, provider stats |
| Payments | `endpoints/payments.py` | invoice, status, verify, settlement, withdraw |
| Reports | `endpoints/reports.py` | provider-bound preview/full report access |
| Wallets/profile | `endpoints/wallets.py` | wallet session, summary, payment history, balances |
| Platform | `endpoints/platform.py` | platform summary, payments, payers, metrics |
| Internal | `endpoints/internal.py` | authenticated gateway callbacks and split-leg operations |
| Chat | `endpoints/chat.py` | chat/copilot boundary where enabled |

## Shared agent decision flow

The decision route is deliberately not a payment executor. It resolves a
canonical candidate and policy result; the caller decides whether to continue
to invoice/payment.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Request[POST /api/v1/agent/decision] --> Schema[Validate AgentDecisionRequest]
    Schema --> Recs[Build live recommendations]
    Recs --> Entitlements[Load wallet entitlements]
    Entitlements --> Plan[LLM structured plan or deterministic fallback]
    Plan --> Resolve[Resolve provider, query, tier, and authoritative price]
    Resolve --> Policy[Check budget, max price, allowlists, score, ownership]
    Policy --> Response[Return plan + resolved_candidate + policy_check]
    Response --> Caller[React hook or external CLI]
    Caller --> Invoice[POST /api/v1/payment/invoice]
    Invoice --> X402[x402 creator/platform legs]
    X402 --> Verify[POST /api/v1/payment/verify]
    Verify --> Entitlement[Persist entitlement and issue short-lived token]
    Entitlement --> Report[Provider preview/full report endpoint]
```

The LLM may propose only a minimal plan. It never supplies the authoritative
price, recipient, query, invoice secret, split leg, settlement id, access
token, or report content.

## Payment and unlock sequence

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant Buyer as React/CLI buyer
    participant API as FastAPI backend
    participant Store as Repository
    participant Gateway as Arc Gateway sidecar
    participant Circle as Circle Gateway
    participant Report as Provider report service

    Buyer->>API: POST /api/v1/payment/invoice
    API->>Store: Save provider/query/tier-bound invoice
    API-->>Buyer: Invoice + x402 requirements
    Buyer->>Gateway: Submit signed creator leg
    Gateway->>Circle: Verify and settle x402 authorization
    Circle-->>Gateway: Settlement receipt
    Gateway-->>Buyer: Creator-leg result
    Buyer->>Gateway: Submit signed platform leg
    Gateway->>Circle: Verify and settle platform authorization
    Circle-->>Gateway: Settlement receipt
    Gateway-->>Buyer: Platform-leg result
    Buyer->>API: POST /api/v1/payment/verify
    API->>Circle: Refresh authoritative settlement status when required
    API->>Store: Persist payment events and entitlement only after all required legs pass
    API-->>Buyer: Payment state + access token when permitted
    Buyer->>Report: POST preview/full report + token
    Report->>Store: Verify invoice, token, wallet, provider, tier, query
    Report-->>Buyer: Paid report JSON
```

Required invariants:

- one invoice binds amount, asset, network, provider, tier, query fingerprint,
  and payer wallet;
- a split invoice does not issue a new access token until every required leg
  is accepted/final according to the active settlement policy;
- expired, failed, or disputed invoices do not unlock reports;
- retries are idempotent and must not duplicate payment events or entitlements;
- report access is wallet-bound and token expiry is enforced server-side.

## Persistence boundary

Endpoint code delegates state changes through services and the repository
boundary. The active deployment may use JSON-compatible storage or Supabase
depending on configuration. Do not assume the authoritative store from a file
name; inspect `backend/app/core/config.py`, repository initialization, and the
deployment environment before changing persistence behavior.

## Local development

From the repository root:

```powershell
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

The canonical module can also be started directly:

```powershell
python -m uvicorn backend.app.main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

Run the gateway sidecar separately when testing real x402 integration:

```powershell
cd arc_gateway
npm install
npm start
```

Read [`PAYMENT_FLOW.md`](../PAYMENT_FLOW.md) before changing payment or
settlement behavior. Read [`docs/DEPLOYMENT_SETUP.md`](../docs/DEPLOYMENT_SETUP.md)
before changing Render startup or service variables.

## Verification

```powershell
python -m pytest -q
```

For the agent boundary, run the targeted decision tests and an HTTP smoke test
against a local server. Do not use live Circle, Supabase, or real funds for
contract tests.
